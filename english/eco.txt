A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.3 struck southern Japan early Saturday, barely 24 hours after a smaller quake hit the same region and killed 10 people.

It was not immediately clear whether the latest quake increased the death toll, but authorities said hundreds of calls had come in from residents reporting people trapped inside houses and buildings. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 66 people were trapped inside a nursing home in Mashiki, the hardest-hit town, and rescue efforts were underway. No other details were immediately available.

More than 400 people were treated at hospitals, but most of their injuries were not life-threatening, the Japanese broadcaster NHK said, citing its own tally. Video showed a resident, apparently rescued from underneath a collapsed house, on a stretcher being taken to a hospital by ambulance.

Meanwhile, the Kumamoto Prefecture reported that a 10th person had died in the 6.5 magnitude quake that struck late Thursday.

Saturday\u2019s quake shook the Kumamoto region at 1.25 a.m. on Saturday local time, and several aftershocks soon followed. Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency issued an advisory for a tsunami up to 1m along the coast west of the epicenter in Kumamoto, but it was lifted less than an hour later.

The agency upgraded the magnitude to 7.3 from an initial reading of 7.1. Compared to the temblor that struck late Thursday night just south of Mashiki, the most recent quake and aftershocks appeared to be moving east, spreading damage to the northeast.
